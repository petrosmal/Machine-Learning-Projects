# Machine-Learning-Projects


## Datasets:
 - Airline Passenger Satisfaction - Bootcamp
   In collaboration with:
   (1)Marios Almpanopoulos, 
   (2)Petros Batakis.
   This project includes the creation of a supervised machine learning algorithm and a presentation of its application, in order to study the levels of airline 
   passenger satisfaction. It was performed during the Big Blue Data Science Bootcamp (2023).
 - Stroke Healthcare
 - Credit Card

## Algorithms:
#### - Linear Regression:
-A regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.
#### - Logistic Regression:
-A classification algorithm used to estimate the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more independent variables. It uses a logistic function to model the relationship between the variables.
#### - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
- A simple algorithm that classifies new data points based on the majority vote of their k nearest neighbors in the feature space.
#### -  XGBOOST:
- Is a powerful and popular algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is an optimized implementation of the gradient boosting framework, which combines the predictions of multiple weak learners (decision trees) to create a strong predictive model.


### The main objectives of these projects are:
 - To develop accurate machine learning models for predicting specific variables.
 - Examine how the predicted variables are related to the domain or problem  that we  are addressing in your projects.
 - Gain insights into the factors influencing these variables and their potential impact.
