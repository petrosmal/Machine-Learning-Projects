### Datasets:
 - Airline Passenger Satisfaction - Bootcamp
   In collaboration with:
    Marios Almpanopoulos, 
    Petros Batakis.

## 1. Airline Passenger Satisfaction

### Description:
This project analyzes a dataset containing an airline passenger satisfaction survey from Kaggle. The aim is to identify factors that are highly correlated with passenger satisfaction and to build models that can predict passenger satisfaction based on various features in the dataset.

### Data - Files:
- Supervised Project-Bootcamp.ipynb : The jupyter code notebook
- requirements.txt : The packages that we should install with this command:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
-  Supervised ML project : A power point file with the project presentation
- test_air.csv and train_air.csv : The Train and Test files

### Steps 
1. Exploratory - Cleaning
2. Visualization
3. Machine Learning


## 2. Pneumonia Detection
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for the detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Utilizing the dataset provided by Kaggle, the model classifies X-ray images into two categories: pneumonia and normal (healthy). The goal is to aid in the early and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia, which is crucial for effective treatment and patient care.
### Data - Files:
- Pneumonia.ipynb : The jupyter code notebook
### Context of Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)" dataset available on Kaggle. It contains:

- Training set: 5,216 images
- Validation set: 16 images
- Test set: 624 images
Each set contains images labeled as either pneumonia or normal.
### Steps 
1. Setup and Data Preparation
2. Data Augmentation
3. Build the CNN Model
4. Compile the Model
5. Train the Model
6. Evaluate the Model

### The main objectives of these projects are:
 - To develop accurate machine learning models for predicting specific variables.
 - Examine how the predicted variables are related to the domain or problem  that we  are addressing in your projects.
 - Gain insights into the factors influencing these variables and their potential impact.
